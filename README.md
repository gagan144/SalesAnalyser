1. The application takes set of inputs from the user that include personal information, company’s past performance and a questioner that consist of twelve multiple choice questions to understand sales process in the client’s organization. 
2. Next, the application applies an algorithm based on certain business dimensions and facts to process all inputs.
3. It then generates output in form of graphs and text specifying weak areas and suggestions to improve them.
4. The application also generates a PDF file containing all discussion.
5. The application is supported by a primary database that stores information of clients consulted which later can be used for future reference. The user can select data and load it into the application for analysis.
